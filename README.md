This paper will provide you with deeper knowledge and understanding that how each variable or sets of variables affect the graduation rate of complete nation and states within it. 
For evaluation each variables effect on the graduation rate we used some of the “Data Classification Models”, which help us evaluate accuracy for predicting the graduation rate. 
Each of the data classification models have their different methods of prediction and accuracy to the data, the model which fits best to our data is selected and is used. 
Also, in this research we have looked at the accuracy rate of selected classification model for each state with different variable sets which gives us the understanding that which are the variables in respective states affecting graduation of states. 
Above things discussed is briefly explained in the following paper.
